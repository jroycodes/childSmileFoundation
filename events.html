    <h1>SCHOOL OPENING FOR THE YEAR 2023</h1>
    <p>The school opening for the year 2023 saw a beatiful day, February 6, 2023, it was a Monday
        Very nice to see children escorted by their parents back to school after two month holidays.
        For many children, this is their first time to be in school! They came, very observants around
        for the youngest, they wanted to go back home with their parents, they did not understand why
        they were left at school. Some cried, wanting to go back home with their parents!

        <h1>WHY SHOULD WE INVEST IN EDUCATING OUR CHILDREN?</h1>

        <br>
    <p>
        Educating children is as old as the time when the first child was born in the world. 
        Parents have the responsibility to educate their children in matters regarding morals, 
        religion, reading and writing and also some trade. Basically this was done well because children 
        could easily learn from their parents as they see them together, spending quality time together. 
        This generation is very different because of lack of employment and many times parents get 
        employment very far away from home, leaving children with their mothers and some times alone 
        to care for their fellow children. Parent are doing well to make sure that their children receive 
        basic education that allows them to prepare for their future life, a time when no child is living 
        with his parents and when the child becomes responsible for himself and those he cares for. The Way
        parents view education matters for the future of their children. Child Smile Foundation is a voice
        calling on everyone to take responsibility to educate children. Once educated, they can live to be
        thankful to their parents.
