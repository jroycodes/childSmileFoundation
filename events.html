                Educating children is as old as the time when the first child was born in the world. 
                Parents have the responsibility to educate their children in matters regarding morals, 
                religion, reading and writing and also some trade. Basically this was done well because children 
                could easily learn from their parents as they see them together, spending quality time together. 
                This generation is very different because of lack of employment and many times parents get 
                employment very far away from home, leaving children with their mothers and some times alone 
                to care for their fellow children.

                Parent are doing well to make sure that their children receive 
                basic education that allows them to prepare for their future life, a time when no child is living 
                with his parents and when the child becomes responsible for himself and those he cares for. The Way
                parents view education matters for the future of their children. Child Smile Foundation is a voice
                calling on everyone to take responsibility to educate children. Once educated, they can live to be
                thankful to their parents.
