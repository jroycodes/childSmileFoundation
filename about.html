                Child Smile Foundation is a community based 
                organization intended to provide protection and safety to all children
                especially the most defenseless in our communities by providing 
                education, food and clothes and to the most vulnerable. 
                Child smile foundation wishes to see that all the children in our 
                communities receive care and love from parents, guardians and fellow 
                socialites in the community.
                An Asian proverb states:
                  If you're planning for a year sow seeds, if you're planning for ten years plant trees but if 
                  you're planning for a hundred years, educate people.
              </p>

                <p class="main_art">
                  Indeed when it comes to providing solutions that are long lasting, education is imperative 
                  because it develops a person's ability to make decisions that will improve his life.
                  One of the best gifts we can pass on to our children is to provide them with education as
                  a tool to fight ignorance and poverty in order to live in prosperous communities.
                  We believe that if children are educated, they will become better equipped to deal with the
                  problems of life. They can also gain moral strength needed to overcome harmful habits.
