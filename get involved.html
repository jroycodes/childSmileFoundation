    <h2>WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN BE INVOLVED</h2>
    <p>There are many ways you can be involved in supporting orphans and vulnerable children in Ugands in general, and here in Wakiso District in particular.

       <ul>
        <li>Pray for an Orphan</li>
        <li>Send a flower of love to Orphans</li>
        <li>Share their Stories with your frinds and relatives</li>
        <li>Become a Host Family</li>
        <li>Help Families Stay Together</li>
        <li>Give Your Financial Support</li>
        <li>Sponsor the Education of an Oprhan or Orphans</li>
        <li>Consider Foster Care</li>

       </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>BECOME A VOLUNTEER</h3>
    <p>We are encouraging all those who can spare some of their precious time to volunteer at Child Smile Foundation, we need people who can help us organize our files in the office, work regularly to update our website, teach English, Mathematic or Science. These subjects are very important for the future of the children. We also need some people who can teach them hands on skills such as carpentry, tailoring, hair cutting, braiding hair, lessons about hygiene especially for the child girl and many other things that can benefit all these children in the future.

 

        Many retired professional men and women are out there who can use their present circumstances to pass on their talents to this new generation. We cannot afford to let these professionals just die and disappear with all the great wealth of knowledge they have acquired over the years. It is vital if they can pass on such skills and knowledge to others especially those who could never attain such honor by themselves. By so doing we keep these professionals alive and many will continue to benefit from them even when the owners had passed away.</p>

        <h3>BE A FUNDRAISER</h3>
        <p>
            You can fundraise for one of our projects like building a classroom, painting a classroom, you can even fundraise to pay one of our teachers at Mercy Nursery and Primary School. As a project that supports orphans and vulnerable children, we use the principle of equalizing, where one child can pay school fees and it supports another child whose parents are unable to pay school fees for their children. For this reason, we try our best to make sure that we raise funds to pay teachers so that those who cannot afford to pay school fees can also benefit in the program.

        You can also fundraise for a meal for a learner or a group of learners because many learners spend the whole day at school without a meal, learning on an empty stomach is a very difficult endeavor. It is our humble request to all our friends, and most especially friends of children around the world to support our project.
