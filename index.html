              <p class="main_art">
                Established in 2007, the Child Smile          Foundation emerged in response to a pressing issue in Wakiso District. Numerous children were being left without familial support due to various circumstances. Whether due to accidents, chronic illnesses, or other reasons, these vulnerable youngsters were finding themselves abandoned at a young age. Recognizing this urgent need, the organization's founding members took action. They initiated the Child Smile Foundation to provide rapid and crucial assistance in times of tragedy.

We vehemently oppose economic exploitation and needless intrusion. Our mission includes shielding them from pain, fear, and unnecessary distress.

        <h1 span id="bold">FAMILY SUPPORT EMPOWERMEMENT</h1>
        <p class="main_art">To support effectively the children from poor families and backgrounds, we came to realise that we must support the families and caregivers. It may not make a great impact to offer free education to a child who comes 
           from a very poor family if that family cannot provides even for the basics of that child's needs. The truth is that we must empower the family to support the child. Remember that we may provide free education to an orphan 
           but the family will provide shelter, protection, food, clothes and healthcare concerns when this child falls sick. This is a clear indication that if we wanr to support the children in effective ways then we must support 
           their families that are bucking them up in various ways.
        </p>
        <p class="main_art" >The cause of poverty in most african countries is caused by the fact that families cannot afford even the minimum of their daily needs. If we address the poverty at family level, then we are on the right path. 
           Addressing poverty at family level is to address poverty at the root level. This is very important to understand, poverty must be fought at family level, heads of the family or families must be empowered to care 
           for their own. When families are empowered to care for their own, they do it with much joy because the family is caring for what is its own. The children belong to the family first before they belong to the State. 
           This is a fact that both the State institutions and the family institution must understand if both are determined to save the family and the children. All the efforts put in this direction is worthwhile because 
           it will bear good fruits in the future when the family is stable and support back the government in many ways. If we want to reduce poverty in any community, the family is the starting point and not the last.

        <p class="main_art">As a way to reduce ignorance and illiteracy, our organization has set up an educational centre to try and support some orphans and vulnerable children who could not be allowed in the schools in their community because 
          their families cannot affort to pay school fees and school requirements in those schools. This educational centre was established in 2009 in a four rooms makeshift structure to help vulnerable children to be in school. 
          This centre was set up at Ssisa Sub-county headquarters in Wakiso district many years ago. This education has served many children to receive primary education in many local communities in Wakiso without discrimination. 
         We wish to continue supporting many more children with this initiative as long as the funds are available to run the institution.</p>
