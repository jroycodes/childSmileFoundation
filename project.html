            <h2>CONSTRUCTION OF CLASSROOMS</h2>
            <p class="objectives">
                To accommodate the growing number of students at Lweza Mercy Nursery and Primary School, urgent construction of classrooms is underway. This expansion aims to enhance the learning environment for our young learners. Currently, the school operates 10 classrooms, comprising 3 for the nursery section and 7 for the primary section. However, there remains a pressing need for additional classrooms to provide children with an optimal learning environment.</p>

              <p class="main_art">As a way to reduce ignorance and illiteracy, our organization has set up an educational centre to try and support some orphans and vulnerable children who could not be allowed in the schools in their community because 
                their families cannot affort to pay school fees and school requirements in those schools. This educational centre was established in 2009 in a four rooms makeshift structure to help vulnerable children to be in school. 
                This centre was set up at Ssisa Sub-county headquarters in Wakiso district many years ago. This education has served many children to receive primary education in many local communities in Wakiso without discrimination. 
               We wish to continue supporting many more children with this initiative as long as the funds are available to run the institution.</p>
